            Whether you’re a first-time home buyer, looking to upgrade, or ready for the perfect retirement home, one of the most important and least talked about things during the home buying process is personal finances. When you speak to a lender they’re gonna want to know your financial situation in order to know how much they can safely lend you to buy your home. Ideally, you’d want to have this meeting when you’re in your best financial position. However, there are a couple things you should be aware of that may be undercutting your position. <br> <br>
<strong>Here’s 2 ways that you’re ruining your hurting finances and you don’t even realize it</strong> <br> <br>
First, and probably the most common, is you’re spending more money that you’re bringing in. I know that this sounds ridiculously simple, but most people don’t even keep track of their income and finances. And that usually leads to high credit card debt, which in turn, leads to a high debt to income ratio. This is something lenders rely heavily on when determining the amount of money you can borrow when buying a home. The higher your debt-to-income ratio, the less money you can borrow to buy a home, which means less buying power, and the less likely you are to buy the home of your dreams. <br> <br>
The fix is pretty simple. Use a personal budgeting app like mint or personal capital. This will allow you to keep track of all your income streams, easily keep track of your spending, and also make recommendations of where you can cut back and improve your finances. Better finances leads to a better credit score and better chances of <a href="https://www.fernandorazo.com/dreamhome.html">landing your dream home</a> ! <br> <br>
The second and probably the most important is putting off investing until you get older. I get that bills can be expensive and you love spending your hard earned money on things you enjoy. But even setting aside a small percentage of your income each month will make a huge difference down the road! The whole mentality of “I’ll get to it later” is just costing you a lot of potential upside. This is a simple fix too but you gotta do it. <br> <br>
Start automatically setting aside money into an investment account and just set it and forget it. There are great apps that help you do this automatically, like Acorns, ETrade, and Charles Schwab, to name a few. These sites allow you to link your bank account and take automatic withdrawals into a brokerage account. From there you can easily set up an investment strategy and be on your way to build long-term wealth! <br> <br>
These tips encompass the two major things lenders look at when appraising your financial situation: debt-to-income ratio and your assets. The lower your debt-to-income ratio and the more assets you have, the more buying power you will have to <a href="https://www.fernandorazo.com/dreamhome.html">buy your dream home</a> ! Though these are just a couple ways to improve your financial situation, they can make a world of difference when you have that first meeting with the lender.
